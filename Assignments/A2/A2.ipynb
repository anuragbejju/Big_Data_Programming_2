If your career goal is to become a data scientist, you have to master some skills for data cleaning and integration. In this assignment, you will go through the solution to Entity Resolution (ER), a very common problem in data cleaning and integration. After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",

    "ER is defined as finding different records that refer to the same real-world entity, e.g., iPhone 4-th generation vs. iPhone four. It is central to data integration and cleaning. In this assignment, you will learn how to apply ER in a data integration setting. But the program that you are going to write can be easily extended to a data-cleaning setting, being used to detect _duplication values_.   \n",

In order to do so, you decide to write a web scraper to crawl product data from Amazon.com and Google Shopping, respectively, and then integrate the data together. Since the same product may have different representations in the two websites, you are facing an ER problem. \n",

These returned record pairs are thought of as matching pairs, i.e., referring to the same real-world entity. \n",

    "1. Jaccard is used to quantify the similarity between two sets instead of two records. You need to convert each record to a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A naive implementation of similarity join is to compute Jaccard for all $|R \\times S|$ possible pairs. Imagine R and S have one million records. This requires doing 10^12 pair comparisons, which is extremely expensive. Thus, you need to know how to avoid n^2 comparisons. \n",

Thus, the ER result should be a set of identified matching pairs, denoted by R. One thing that we want to know is that what percentage of the pairs in $R$ that are truly matching? This is what Precision can tell us. Let $T$ denote the truly matching pairs in $R$. Precision is defined as:\n",
